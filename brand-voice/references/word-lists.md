# Word Lists and Vocabulary Guidance

Organized vocabulary preferences for brand and corporate writing.

## Out-of-Favor Words

- Arresting
- Beautiful
- Excellent
- Exquisite
- Extraordinary
- Incredible

### Overused Qualifiers
- Really
- Truly
- Very

### Premium/Luxury Clichés
- Luxury / luxurious
- Premier
- Perfect (except as proper noun, e.g., "Perfect Facial Hydrating Cream")

### Words Too Precious for Commerce
- Love (save it for actual love)
- Soul (deserves better than marketing copy)

### Vague Descriptors
- Natural (unless literally describing ingredients)
- Organic (unless literally describing ingredients)

- Special

## Beloved Words

## Words of the In-Between

Use sparingly, after due consideration. These are strong words that can work in the right context:

### Elevated Descriptors
- Alluring
- Artful
- Astute
- Consummate
- Elegant
- Ideal
- Immaculate
- Indulgent
- Meticulous
- Refined
- Relish
- Striking

## Word Pairs: Choose Carefully

### Advice / Advise
- **Advice** = noun ("My advice is...")
- **Advise** = verb ("I advise you to...")

### Affect / Effect
Most commonly:
- **Affect** = verb ("Her diet affected her skin")
- **Effect** = noun ("The effect was noticeable")

Less common uses:
- **Affect** = noun (psychology: observed emotional state)
- **Effect** = verb (accomplish/put in place: "The balm effected smoother skin")

### Aroma / Scent / Fragrance
- **Aroma** = preferred term
- **Scent** = use sparingly
- **Fragrance** = avoid when possible

### Utilise / Use
- **Use** = always preferred
- **Utilise** = avoid (unnecessarily formal)

## Compound Words and Hyphenation

### One Word (No Hyphen)
- Aftershave
- Antifungal
- Antiseptic

### Hyphenated
- Anti-bacterial
- Anti-inflammatory
- Anti-Oxidant (or anti-oxidant, depending on context)

### Two Words
- All right (never "alright")

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Apostrophes
Place immediately after the owner:
- "The team's work" (one team)
- "The teams' work" (multiple teams)
- "The children's tea" (children own the tea)

Exception: "its" (possessive) has no apostrophe. "It's" = "it is."

### Passive Voice Hiding Agency
**Weak:** "Mistakes were made"  
**Strong:** "We made mistakes"

**Weak:** "It was decided"  
**Strong:** "The team decided"

### Jargon to Eliminate
- Leverage → Use / Apply
- Utilize → Use
- Synergy → (be specific about what you mean)
- Circle back → Return to / Revisit
- Align → (be specific: agree, coordinate, match)

## Context-Specific Guidance

### Product Descriptions
Favor:
- Botanical names when appropriate
- Specific effects over vague benefits
- Sensory details (aroma, texture) over emotional claims
- "Suitable for" over "perfect for"

Avoid:
- Superlatives without evidence
- Emotional manipulation
- Overused beauty industry clichés

### Email Sign-offs
Appropriate:
- "Thank you for your patience"
- "Should you have any questions"
- "We appreciate your confidence"
- "I look forward to hearing from you"

Avoid:
- "Excited to connect!"
- "Have a blessed day"
- Overly casual sign-offs in formal contexts

### Invitations and Announcements
Use passive voice to center the recipient:
- "You are warmly invited" (not "We're excited to invite you")
- "Please join us" (simple, direct)

Avoid:
- "Thrilled to announce"
- "Excited to share"
- "Proud to present"
- Excessive exclamation points

## When in Doubt

1. **Choose the simpler word** (use over utilize)
2. **Choose the more specific word** (strode over walked quickly)
3. **Choose the word that sounds like a human said it** (not corporate-speak)
4. **Choose precision over qualification** (one strong word over weak word + adverb)
