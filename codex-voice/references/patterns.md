# Sentence Patterns

Copyable syntactic structures that capture this voice. Use these as templates, not content to reproduce.

## Opening Moves

### Narrative Drop-In
Start mid-story, not with context:
- "Back in 2010, a movement started without a name."
- "There is a certain ceremony that happens on data teams everywhere when new people come on board."

### Shared Exhaustion
Name a collective frustration:
- "Everyone is weary of fighting over programming languages."
- "Nobody likes feeling locked into their stack."

### The List That Sets Stakes
Name concrete actors before explaining:
- "Meta is building their own data system. Walmart is building their own data system. So is Microsoft, GE, Netflix, Airbnb, Apple, Two Sigma, Twitter, Man Group, Goldman Sachs, and the list goes on."

## Transition Moves

### Genuine Question as Pivot
- "So, why are companies like Netflix building their own data systems in-house?"
- "Why start there?"
- "What does this new frontier of data systems look like?"

### The Acknowledgment-Then-Pushback
- "While X sounds great, the reality is..."
- "This all seems reasonable until you consider..."

## Tension Patterns

### The Neat/Annoying Parallel
Name both sides of a tradeoff in parallel structure:
- "The neat thing about a composable data system is you get to pick your own modules. The annoying thing about a composable data system is you get to pick your own modules."

### The Honest Asterisk
- "Here's how you want connecting to a database to work* (*and what will get in the way of making it work)"
- "The plumbing works* (*-ish)"

### Skepticism Engaged, Not Dismissed
- "You might be skeptical about standards (cue the requisite xkcd cartoon)." Then engage the skepticism seriously.

## Explanation Patterns

### Concrete Then Abstract
Always show an example before naming the concept:
- [Show Netflix, Meta, Walmart building systems] → "These companies have effectively started building their own data systems in-house. What does that look like?"

### The Definition That Doesn't Feel Like One
Embed definitions in flow:
- "A module is a 'chunk of reusable software' that does one thing well."
- Not: "Definition: A module is..."

### The Smell Test
Frame evaluation as practical questions:
- "Here are some questions you can ask of your modules: Are you focused? Are you independent? Are you interchangeable?"

## Quote Integration

### Quotes for Texture, Not Authority
Weave in as "others have seen this too":
- "As Benn Stancil put it: 'bigger, faster, and polyglot.'"
- "Or as one engineer put it: 'People and politics are the bottleneck. Not performance.'"

### The Practitioner's Confession
Real frustration from real people:
- "We spend the majority of our days trying to configure OpenSprocket 2.3.1 to work with NeoGidgetPro5..."

## Technical Explanation Patterns

### The Metaphor That Earns Its Place
- "The cook's tour of an old historic home" (for onboarding knowledge transfer)
- "Spaghetti architecture" (for unmaintained systems)
- "Trapdoor data pipelines" (easy to fall into, hard to climb out)

### The System Diagram in Words
Walk through layers, then show the diagram:
- "A minimal viable data system can be broken down into three main layers:" [then visual]

### Acknowledging Ghost Knowledge
- "Based purely on vibes and my past experience (aka ghost knowledge)..."
- Names intuition as real, not something to hide

## Closing Moves

### Direction, Not Summary
- "In the next chapter, we will..."
- "The question becomes: how do we start augmenting what we have?"

### Honest Incompleteness
- "They are realizing that maybe the real data system nirvana was the open source projects and standards they met along the way."
- Acknowledge what's still unresolved

### The Practical Handoff
- "Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can." —Arthur Ashe
