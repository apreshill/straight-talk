# social-voice

Transform social media copy from performative relatability into genuine, crisp communication that respects the reader's scroll.

## Foundation

This skill builds on **brand-voice** principles. If you haven't internalized those yet, start there. This adds the constraints and patterns specific to social media.

Core truth: Social media rewards brevity, specificity, and getting to the point. Your reader is scrolling. Earn their attention by respecting their time.

## Core Philosophy

**Get to the point.** No throat-clearing. No setup. Drop into the middle of the situation.

**Show, don't tell.** Name the actual artifacts (zip files, Slack DMs, broken scripts) not the abstract categories (manual processes, communication overhead).

**Let brevity create impact.** If you can cut it in half and it still works, cut it in half.

**Silence creates tension.** The space between problem and solution is where the reader feels the pain. Don't fill it with explanation.

**Respect the scroll.** Every word must earn its place. Your reader's thumb is already moving.

## The LLM Slop Test

If your draft includes any of these patterns, rewrite from scratch:

### The Setup Formula
**Bad:**
- "You [did X]. Your [person] needs [Y]."
- "You're [doing X]. You need: 1. 2. 3."
- "There's a better way."

This is the default LLM structure for "relatable" content. It's instantly recognizable as AI-generated.

**Better:**
Drop into the middle of the situation. No setup, no "you know what happens next."

**Example:**

❌ **LLM slop:**
> You've built a great model. Your teammate needs to use it. You send them a pickle file and hope for the best.

✅ **Human:**
> Your teammate asks for your model. You send a pickle file. They send back an error message. You send environment.yml. They send back a different error message.

### Mechanical Feature Lists
**Bad:**
- "function() does X—explanation of what it does"
- Each feature gets equal weight and explanation
- Reads like documentation

**Better:**
Show the outcome, not the mechanism. Let brevity create impact.

**Example:**

❌ **LLM slop:**
> replicate() creates a copy of your data—it handles the serialization and ensures your teammate gets a working version they can query immediately

✅ **Human:**
> They run pxt.replicate(). They get a working table. Done.

### False Conversational Tone
**Bad:**
- "Let me show you"
- "Here's how"
- "Here's the thing"
- Explaining that you're about to explain something

**Better:**
Just state it. Trust the reader to follow the shift.

### Over-Explanation
**Bad:**
Telling the reader what they already understand from context.

**Better:**
Let the reader infer the benefits. Respect their intelligence.

**Example:**

❌ **Over-explained:**
> They get a working table they can query immediately. No reconstruction needed. No path debugging required.

✅ **Crisp:**
> They get a working table. Done.

## Platform-Specific Guidance

### LinkedIn
**Character sweet spot:** 150-300 characters for the hook (first 2-3 lines before "see more")

**Hook requirements:**
- Must work standalone
- Must create curiosity or recognition
- No throat-clearing allowed

**Structure that works:**
1. Concrete situation (1-2 lines)
2. The tension/problem (1-2 lines)  
3. The insight or solution (brief)
4. Optional: What changes (1 line max)

**What to avoid:**
- "I'm excited to share"
- "Hot take:"
- Numbered lists that could be prose
- Emoji bullets (unless your brand already uses them consistently)

### Twitter/X
**The 280 constraint is a gift.** It forces clarity.

**Structure:**
- Concrete situation or observation
- The tension
- The insight
- (Optional thread if needed, but can it be one tweet?)

**Thread guidance:**
- Each tweet must work standalone
- No "1/7" unless absolutely necessary
- The first tweet is the whole story compressed
- Subsequent tweets are elaboration, not continuation

### General Social Rules

**The Half Test:**
If you can cut your draft in half and it still works, cut it in half.

**The Read-Aloud Test:**
Would you actually say this out loud to a colleague? Or are you performing "relatability"?

**The Scroll Test:**
Your reader's thumb is moving. Did you earn the stop?

## What to Eliminate

### Performative Relatability
- "You know what grinds my gears?"
- "Can we talk about [thing]?"
- "This. This right here."
- "Say it louder for the people in the back"

### Meta-Commentary
- "This might be controversial but"
- "Unpopular opinion:"
- "I said what I said"
- Apologizing for having an opinion

### Engagement Bait
- "Agree? 👇"
- "Tag someone who needs to see this"
- "Double tap if you relate"
- "What do you think? Comment below!"

### LLM Tells
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "Let's dive in"
- "Here's the thing"
- "At the end of the day"
- The Setup Formula (see above)

## Structure Patterns That Work

### The Situation Drop-In
Start in the middle of a specific moment.

**Example:**
> Your teammate asks for your model. You send a pickle file. They send back an error message.

### The Artifact List
Name the actual things, not the categories.

**Bad:** "Manual data transfer processes"  
**Good:** "Zip files. Slack messages about bucket credentials. Screenshots of file paths."

### The Compressed Narrative
Tell the whole story in 3 lines.

**Example:**
> You build a model. Your teammate needs it. You spend 3 hours debugging their environment instead of your code.

### The Before/After (Without Saying Before/After)
Show the contrast through concrete details.

**Example:**
> Used to: zip file, Slack DM, "did you get it?", error message, environment.yml, different error message.
>
> Now: pxt.replicate(). Done.

### The Honest Tension
Name the tradeoff plainly.

**Example:**
> This takes 10 minutes to set up. It saves 3 hours every time someone needs your work. Do the math.

## The Social Media Test

Before posting, ask:

1. **Did I get to the point in the first 2 lines?**
2. **Am I showing (concrete artifacts) or telling (abstract categories)?**
3. **Can I cut this in half?**
4. **Would I actually say this out loud?**
5. **Am I performing relatability or being relatable?**
6. **Does this sound like an LLM wrote it?**
7. **Am I respecting my reader's scroll?**

If you fail any of these, rewrite.

## Word Count Targets

**LinkedIn post:** 50-150 words (hook must work in first 150 characters)  
**Twitter/X:** 100-280 characters (aim for one tweet if possible)  
**Thread starter:** Must contain the complete thought compressed

**The rule:** If you're over the target, you're explaining too much.

## Voice Markers for Social

- **Use concrete artifacts:** "pickle file" not "model file"
- **Use actual actions:** "They run X" not "They utilize X"
- **Use silence:** Let the space between problem and solution breathe
- **Use brevity:** "Done." is a complete sentence
- **Use specifics:** "3 hours" not "significant time"

## What Makes Social Different from Brand-Voice

**Brand-voice says:** Be clear and respectful  
**Social-voice says:** Be clear, respectful, AND compressed

**Brand-voice says:** Acknowledge tension  
**Social-voice says:** Let the tension sit in silence

**Brand-voice says:** Concrete before abstract  
**Social-voice says:** Only concrete. No abstract.

**Brand-voice says:** Respect the reader's time  
**Social-voice says:** Respect the reader's scroll

## LinkedIn-Specific Guidance

### Evaluating Your Hook

Before you post, test your first line against these three criteria:

**1. Newness (0-10)**
How likely is it your audience has heard this before?

- "Sales is important" → Not new to anyone
- "Artists need to become salespeople" → New to that specific audience

**2. Relevance (0-10)**
Does this help your audience do their job better?

- "Clay vs wax for hair styling" → Irrelevant to developers
- "This database query pattern cut our response time by 40%" → Relevant to developers

**3. Crunch (0-10)**
Does your claim have enough structure that people can react to it?

"Databases are important" has no crunch—nothing to agree or disagree with. "ORMs make your queries slower" has crunch—people will have opinions.

Listen for your own hesitation. If you're thinking "people will have thoughts about this," you've found the crunch.

**The balance:** You need at least two of these at 7+. All three at 5 is forgettable.

### Platform Mechanics

**Character limit:** 3,000 characters (~500 words)
Don't pad to hit the limit. Say what you need to say.

**The hook matters:**
- Text posts: First 5 lines before "see more"
- Image/video posts: First 3 lines before "see more"

If your value isn't clear in those lines, no one clicks.

**Emphasis workarounds:**
LinkedIn doesn't support formatting, so:
- Use \*stars\* for emphasis (like italics)
- Use CAPS for strong emphasis (like bold)
Use sparingly.

**Hashtags:**
- Use 2-3 broad hashtags (#developers #databases #performance)
- Not niche hashtags (#databaseperformanceoptimization)
- Lowercase only
- Related to what you're selling/known for, not the specific topic

**@ mentions:**
Tag people and companies when genuinely relevant. Not for reach.

### Common LinkedIn Patterns

These archetypes work, but only if you execute them with our core principles (concrete, brief, honest):

**The Claim**
Your database is probably slower than it needs to be. Here are 3 queries that are killing your performance: [list]

**The Experiment**
Last week we tried connection pooling. Cut our DB response time from 2s to 200ms. Here's what we changed: [specifics]

**The Question**
"How do I optimize this query?" Here's the debugging process: [steps]

**The Objection**
"We can't rewrite this legacy code." You don't have to. Here's what you can do instead: [options]

**The Mistake**
I pushed a migration that dropped a production table. Here's what I learned: [lesson]

**Use these as starting points, not templates.** The structure helps, but the specifics make it work.

### When to Break the Rules

**Genuine announcements deserve excitement:**
If you actually got featured in a publication, hired someone great, or shipped something you're proud of—one or two exclamation points are fine. Just don't perform excitement you don't feel.

**Questions at the end can work:**
- ✅ "What's your debugging process?" (advances thinking)
- ✅ "What would you add?" (genuine curiosity)
- ❌ "Agree? 👇" (engagement bait)
- ❌ "Tag someone who needs this" (spam)

The test: Would you actually want to read the answers?

## Credits and Inspiration

This skill combines:

**brand-voice foundations** (Aesop formality + Intuit clarity + Codex honesty)
- Concrete before abstract
- Tension acknowledged
- Reader as peer
- Say what you mean

**Platform-specific patterns** identified through analysis of:
- LLM-generated social content (anti-patterns)
- Effective technical social media (what actually works)
- The constraints of the medium (character limits, scrolling behavior)

Philosophy: Social media is not a lesser medium. It's a different medium with different constraints. Respect those constraints and you respect your reader.
